		<p>More extended documentation is planned.
			MapGlow is currently a Python MapScript addition to UMN MapServer (though we
			plan to integrate with other WMS servers like GeoServer as well).
			It intercepts WMS GetMap and GetLegendGraphic requests for heatmap generation
			from MapServer Layer Vector (Point-type) sources when the STYLE(S) parameter
			starts with the magic word "heat". In that case MapGlow will query the MS Layer feature data
			and draw a transparent overlay heatmap. The STYLES parameter also determines
			the parametrization of how the heatmap should be drawn in terms of gradient
			colors and other parameters. MapGlow will delegate processing to the standard MapServer OWS dispatching
			for other requests like GetCapabilities
			or when no STYLE(S) is provided.
		</p>

		<h3>Algorithms</h3>

		<p>
			At this moment there is one algorithm called "seth" based on the Free heatmap.py
			program from <a href="http://www.sethoscope.net/heatmap/">www.sethoscope.net</a>.
			This algorithm is in our opinion (loosely) based
			on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting">Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)</a>.
			We are investigating other algorithms like
			<a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/2006/09/20/new-blendings-modes-for-java2d/">Romain Guy's Blend
				Composite</a>
			as well mainly for reasons of
			performance.
			Other implementations to investigate include:
			<a href="http//jjguy.com/heatmap">jjguy.com/heatmap (Python)</a>,
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/gheat">code.google.com/p/gheat (Multilang, but Google Maps only?))</a>,
			<a href="http://blog.felipebarriga.cl/olheatmap_demo">blog.felipebarriga.cl/olheatmap_demo (JavaScript)</a>
			All algorithms will be pluggable so you can supply yours as well.
		</p>

		<h3>STYLE Parameter Encoding</h3>

		<p>
			The general format is
			<strong>STYLES=heat/&lt;algorithm_type&gt;/&lt;algorithm_parms&gt;</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Parameters to the Seth algorithm are: gradient, radius and decay.
			<strong>gradient</strong> determines the color range (0..256), <strong>radius</strong>
			(pixels) how far each "heat-point's" influence reaches and
			<strong>decay</strong> is how fast multiple heat values approach zero
			by decreasing distance from the "heat-point".
			This is encoded as follows for example:
			<strong>STYLES=heat/seth/red-yellow-trans2/12/0.5</strong>.
			Here the gradient is predefined "red-yellow-trans2" (see below), the radius is
			12 pixels and the decay is 0.5.
			See <a href="/wms/?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphic&STYLE=heat/seth/red-yellow-trans2/5/0.4">this
			gradient here.</a>
		</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="/site/media/gradient-red-yellow-trans2.png" alt="Gradient example file"/></td>
				<td><img src="/site/media/gradient-blue-green.png" alt="Gradient example file"/></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			More advanced is that the gradient can be supplied by the client. This is done
			as one or more tuples of 5 parameters: (Stop, Red, Green, Blue, Transparency).
			Each value is a float between 0 and 1.
			Red, Green, Blue, Transparency are RGBA valuies and Stop is where this part of the gradient should stop.
			For example <strong>STYLES=heat/seth/0,0,0,1,0,0.75,1,0,0,1,0.9,1,1,0,0/5/0.2</strong>
			indicates a gradient spec of 0,0,0,1,0,0.75,1,0,0,1,0.9,1,1,0,0. These are 3 tuples
			(0,0,0,1,0) (0.75,1,0,0,1) (0.9,1,1,0,0).

		<h3>Configuration</h3>

		<p>Basically MapServer is configured as usual, using a MapFile. The MapGlow
			interceptor can be invoked simply by supplying a Python CGI with the following lines:
		</p>
<pre>
from mapglow_ms import MapGlowMS

# Main entry: call MapGlow OWS with the mapfile parm
MapGlowMS('../config/mapserver/app1.map').ows_req()

</pre>

		<h3>Other Uses</h3>

		<p>
			Heatmap generation with MapGlow is not just available via WMS.
			Since the heatmap generation modules are totally decoupled from the MapScript
			Python CGI handlers, heatmaps can also be generated via the commandline
			or custom CGI scripts.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the following command generates an 800x600
			heatmap from the commandline using the points file "mydata.coords"
			as input:

		</p>
 <pre>
	 heatmap_seth.py -p .mydata.coords -G mygradient.png -r 5 -d 0.95 -W 800 -hH 600 -o myheatmap.png

 </pre>
		<p>
			Another scenario is using heatmap generation within a CGI environment where
			a client POSTs a points file or points in a form.
